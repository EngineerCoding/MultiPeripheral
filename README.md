MultiPeripheral
===============

This mod is a framework for ComputerCraft. It allows multiple 'hosted' peripherals on one block. It also provides you with easier implementations of IPeripheral or ILuaObject! No more switch(method) calls in your IPeripheral.callMethod!

This Repo does not provide a proper workspace just because of the lack of a server which can host a Jenkins. Feel free to contact me if you want to provide a webserver, or some other place to host my downloads.

If you find any issues with this mod, dont be shy and open an issue!

-- TODO better readme.md :P
